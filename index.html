          Efo Riro is a rich vegetable soup that is native to the Yorubas of
          Western Nigeria. <br />
          The vegetables that can be used to cook this soup are Efo Shoko or Efo
          Tete (Green Amaranth). If these are not readily available where you
          live, leafy or frozen spinach is a very good substitute.the soup can
          been eaten with any swallow of your choice such as:amala,eba,fufu,rice
          and pounded yam.

          <li>
            &nbsp; &nbsp;Place a pan on medium heat and add palm oil, heat for
            about 5 minutes but don't bleach
          </li>
          <li>
            &nbsp; &nbsp;Add locust beans and chopped onions &nbsp; &nbsp;and
            fry for about 2 minutes (In this case, I used half of the locust
            beans and saved the rest before I finished cooking the soup)
          </li>
          <li>
            &nbsp; &nbsp;Add the blended pepper to the palm oil and stir to
            combine, after about 3 minutes, add the remaining locust beans. Add
            the diced ponmo and ground crayfish and cook for another 3-4 minutes
            on low heat
          </li>
          <li>
            &nbsp; &nbsp;Add seasoning (bouillon cube/stock) and pinch of salt.
            (check for salt at the later stage of the cooking)
          </li>
          <li>
            &nbsp; &nbsp;Whilst you are waiting for the sauce to cook, boil
            water enough to cover the vegetable. Once the water is boiled, pour
            over the vegetable and cover with a lid for 5 minutes. Strain and
            squeeze out excess water from the vegetable.
          </li>
          <li>
            &nbsp; &nbsp;Continue to cook the sauce till oil floats on the top,
            add half of the smoked fish and stir to combine. (You can add little
            water to the sauce if it is too dry but do not over do it as efo
            riro is almost water free)
          </li>
          <li>

          <li>
            &nbsp; &nbsp;Add the remaining smoked mackerel and carefully combine
            in the vegetable. Check for salt and cook for another 4 minutes.
